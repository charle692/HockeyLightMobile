# HockeyLight Mobile
The goal of this project is to create a mobile application that can be used to configure and interact with https://github.com/charle692/HockeyLight.

## Installation
This app uses React Native. The reason for this is so that it can be built for both iOS and Android simultaneously.

First off, install React Native. Instructions can be found [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)

Once you have React Native up and running, clone this repository and run `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios`. That's it! If you have any issues or need help, create an issue and I will try to help out.

## App Requirements
 - Allow the user to change which team they are cheering for.
 - Allow the user to set a time delay to prevent the HockeyLight from notifying of a goal before there broadcast does.
 - Works for both iOS and Android.

## Future
 - Allow the user to configure the HockeyLight's wifi settings.
 - Allow the user to set how long the light is on for.
